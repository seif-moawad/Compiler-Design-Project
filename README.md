Introduction

Welcome to our Compiler Design project! In this project, we have implemented a compiler from scratch using C#. The compiler is designed to convert source code written in a specific programming language into executable machine code. Our compiler supports basic data types such as int, float, and char, as well as control flow statements like if and else. To provide a user-friendly experience, we have also created an interface that visualizes the input source code and displays the corresponding output generated by the compiler. This project serves as a practical demonstration of the concepts learned in a typical Compiler Design course. Let's dive into the key features and details of our Compiler Design project.
Features

    Lexical Analysis: The compiler performs lexical analysis, which involves tokenizing the input source code into individual lexemes (tokens) such as identifiers, keywords, operators, and literals.

    Syntax Analysis: The compiler performs syntax analysis, also known as parsing, to verify the correctness of the input source code's grammar. It ensures that the code conforms to the specified programming language's syntax rules.

    Semantic Analysis: The compiler performs semantic analysis, which checks for semantic correctness and consistency. It includes type checking and enforces the programming language's rules regarding variable declarations, data types, and expression evaluation.

    Code Generation: The compiler generates intermediate code or target machine code from the input source code. It transforms the high-level code into low-level instructions that can be executed by the target machine or virtual machine.

    Interface: We have developed an interface that provides a visual representation of the input source code and displays the corresponding output generated by the compiler. This interface enhances the user experience and facilitates understanding and debugging of the compiled code.
